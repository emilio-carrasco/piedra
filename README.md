# Lab | Rock, paper, scissors

## Introduction

In the exercise, you will practice user defined functions through creating a game. You will work on your own but remember the teaching staff is at your service whenever you encounter problems.

## Getting Started

Here you will find two jupyter notebooks: 01-rock-paper-scissors & 02-rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock. First, you will create a simple version in the first file, then, you will extend that same game adding more variables.

## Deliverables

- `01-rock-paper-scissors.ipynb`. 
- `02-rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock.ipynb`.
